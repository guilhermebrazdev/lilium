# Lilium Project Setup

This project consists of a backend API and a frontend. To run the application locally, you will need to use two separate terminals: one for the backend and another for the frontend.

## Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project (`lilium/`).
2. Navigate to the `lilium_api` folder:
   ```bash
   cd lilium_api/
   ```
